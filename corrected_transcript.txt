so the applications are of course we start by wanting to know how olfaction works its last sense that we don't understand everything else we understand pretty well vision audition heat and touch and taste but we still don't really get how olfaction works and from this work we actually also found out that at least flies so fluff lies in addition to looking at the shape of the molecule at their sniffing they also look at the vibrational spectrum which already has made us come up with designs for bettering noses not using the biological component at all but changing it to quantum nanotubes quantum dots I should say and nanotubes and things like this just like we don't make jet engines out of feathers eventually we will not need the biology to do any of these things 

the Qualcomm XPrize which is to make exactly that tricorder that Spock was holding which in two-and-a-half years from now will have to be able to put it in the size of a cell phone give it to a hundred people and over the period of two weeks smell these people without interacting with them directly and be able to tell with 85 percent success rate 15 different diseases 

if you have to take something out of this today I think that the message is that nature already knows how to fly how to make electricity how to compute how to detect odors etc and if nature has shown it to be doable then it is it unavoidable that we will do it this isn't cold fusion cold fusion may or may not work we don't know we've never seen it in nature but to make a device that can fit in a thing like this and sniff cancer yes absolutely it's doable not only doable it's unavoidable 

we already have a grant based on this work to go the next level which is the Star Trek replicator yes believe it or not they are paying me money to build the machine that you can push a button and the cup of tea will materialize out of the 118 elements the periodic table without involving any tea plants or ceramics or anything just atom by atom put it there not quite there yet when state phase 1 but within our lifetime this will happen 

we're making machines that self replicate now this may be scary and you probably right to feel like you need some ownership of this we scientists are sitting out there in our labs how do you get to how do you get to participate the best way I know of is to ask questions it's the ultimate equalizer scientists love questions that's what drives us 

you can engage a scientist by just asking a good question and recognising the importance of questions we have created the molecular frontiers inquiry prize where we award five boys and five girls every year a prize for the best question asked we have the panel including 30 Nobel laureates judging this every time in Stockholm in Sweden and some of the questions are fantastic for instance somebody asked why aren't plants black that's a much better question than asking why are plants green
