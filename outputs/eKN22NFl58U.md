welcome to class number one session number three in this session, we will continue what we have already started in session number two. Of class number one, 2-dimensional structures include thin films, quantum wells, and superlattices as could be seen on the screen as a representative example of a thin film; please have a look at the scanning teling microscope image of a self-assembled monolayer of andican thiolate on gold surface, as seen in the image. The individual molecules are closely packed into a hexagonal array also. Besides that, one can see clearly the features of the assembly and the surface, namely domain boundaries which are highlighted with light blue stripes on the figure, and one can see also gold vacancy islands which can be seen as circular blue spots in the lower image of the screen. You can see a transmission electron microscopy image of a superlattice where alternate layers of two different materials exist in this context. Please note that the thickness of each layer is only 2 nanometers in thickness.

One of the major groups in two-dimensional structures is thin films, namely two-dimensional films with a thickness ranging between 1 to 100 nanometers. When films are very thin, their electronic and optical properties deviate substantially from those of the bulk material as the material is minimized towards the nano scale. The confining dimension naturally decreases, but the characteristics are no longer averaged by the bulk. The energy spectrum becomes in this case discrete and measured by quanta rather than continuous as in the bulk materials.

The confinement of electrons that exist in these systems changes their interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Electrons are confined in the direction that is perpendicular to the substrate and thus affect the wave function as well as the density of states similarly, phonons that are confined in the direction that is perpendicular to the substrate affect therefore the thermal properties. All transport phenomena in two-dimensional structures are highly affected by defects, boundaries, and interfaces that might exist in or at the vicinity of the thin film.

More details about all of these effects will be given in the next classes. Now, we will move on to three-dimensional structures which include bulk nanocrystalline as well as nanostructured bulk materials. Nanostructured bulk materials include several subcategories, which are mentioned in the following: 

The first subcategory is crystalline materials; in this category, the atoms, molecules, or ions that make up a material are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern. In some cases, the regular ordering can continue unbroken over a large scale, such as in the example of diamonds, where each diamond is only single crystal.

The second subcategory is called poly crystalline materials; solid objects that are large enough to see and to handle are rarely composed of single material but instead are made of large numbers of single crystals known as crystalites whose size can vary from a few nanometers to several meters. These materials are called poly crystalline, as mentioned previously. Almost all common metals and many ceramics are poly crystalline in their properties.

The third subcategory of this material is called amorphous materials; this category, which we also call non-crystalline solid, is a solid that lacks the long-range order characteristic of a crystalline material. Indeed, amorphous materials have some short-range order at the atomic length scale due to the nature of chemical bonding. Such solids include amongst the rest glass, plastic, and gel.

Now, we will move on to nanocomposites; a nanocomposite is a multiphase solid material where one of the phases has two or three dimensions less than 100 nanometers in the broadest sense this definition is more usually taken to mean the solid combination of a bulk matrix and nano-dimensional phase differing in properties due to the similarities in structure and chemistry.

The mechanical, electrical, thermal, optical, electrochemical, catalytic properties of the nanocomposite differ quite significantly from those of the component material. Size limits for these effects have been proposed in the scientific literature and include among the rest: 

Composites with less than 5 nanometers are designated for catalytic activity; composites with less than 20 nanometers are designated for making hard magnetic materials, and composites with less than 50 nanometers are designated for refractive index changes. Finally, a composite with less than 100 nanometers is designated for achieving mechanical strengthening or restricting matrix dislocation movement.

Nanocomposites might include combinations of organic material and inorganic material; it also can include a combination of organic and inorganic materials, and finally, it can include a combination of inorganic and inorganic materials. This large amount of reinforcement surface area means that a relatively small amount of nanoscale reinforcement can have an observable effect on the macroscale property of the composite, for example, adding carbon nanotubes improves the electrical and thermal conductivity.

Other kinds of nanoparticulates may result in enhanced optical properties, dielectric properties, heat resistance, or mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength, and resistance to wear and damage. We will come now to the end of class number one, session number three; thank you.
