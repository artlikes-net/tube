Welcome to class number one, session number two. A nanostructure is an object that has at least one dimension in the range of 1 to 100 nanometers. In describing nanostructures, it is needed to differentiate between the number of dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanoclusters are structures that are 1 to 100 nanometer in each spatial dimension; these structures are categorized as zero-dimensional nanostructures. Nanotubes and nanowires have a characteristic diameter between 1 and 100 nanometers, and a length that could be much greater than that; these structures are categorized as one-dimensional nanostructures. Nanocomposite surfaces or thin films have a thickness between 1 and 100 nanometers, while the other two dimensions are much greater; these structures are categorized as two-dimensional complex materials. Finally, bulk materials with all dimensions above 100 nanometers, but that contain zero-dimensional, one-dimensional, and/or two-dimensional nanostructures, are termed three-dimensional nanostructures. We will describe each of these nanostructures in more detail in the next sessions. We will start now with defining the zero-dimensional nanostructure, which includes basically nanoparticles and quantum dots.

Nanoparticles are defined as small objects that are sized between 1 and 100 nanometers, and that behave as a whole unit with respect to its transport properties. Nanoparticles are size-dependent; namely, the properties of the materials change as their size approaches the nanoscale, and as the percentage of the atoms at the surface of the material becomes significant. The interesting and unexpected properties of nanoparticles are therefore significantly due to the large surface area of the material, which dominates the contributions made by the small bulk of the material. For the sake of comparison, bulk materials - mainly particles larger than one micrometer - contain an insignificant percentage of atoms at the surface in relation to the number of atoms in the bulk of the same material; and therefore, they don't behave or exhibit size-dependent changes in their physical properties.

Nanoparticles often possess unexpected optical properties, as they are small enough to confine their electrons and produce quantum effects. The size-dependent color of nanoparticles was utilized - though without any intention - by artists as far back as the 9th century for generating glittering effects on the surface of pots or colors in stained glass. The unique physical properties of nanoparticles allow much higher absorption of solar radiation in photovoltaic cells that are composed of nanoparticles than in thin films of continuous sheets, even if they are composed of the same material. Other size-dependent properties that change include quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasma resonance in some metal nanoparticles, and chemical reactivity that is utilized for image formation and photography.

Now, from zero-dimensional nanostructures, we will move to one-dimensional structures, which include, among others, nanowires, quantum wires, nanorods, and nanotubes. A nanowire is a nanostructure with a diameter of the order of nanometers; alternatively, nanowires can be defined as structures that have a thickness or diameter constrained to tens of nanometers or less, and an unconstrained length. At this scale, quantum mechanical effects are important; and therefore, they are coined the term "quantum wires." Many different types of nanowires exist; these include, of course, metallic nanowires, semiconducting nanowires, and insulating nanowires. More details about each of these nanowires can be seen on the slide, and we will explain them in the next lectures.

On the other hand, molecular nanowires are composed of repeating molecular units - either organic (for example, DNA) or inorganic material. New forms of nanowires include core-shell superlattices; nanowires, as seen in the bottom figure on the slide, have two quantum-confined directions, while still leaving one unconfined direction for electrical conduction. Basically, this feature allows the nanowire to be used in applications where electrical conduction is required. And because of their unique density of electron states, nanowires - in the limit of small diameters - are expected to exhibit significantly different optical, electrical, and magnetic properties from their bulk three-dimensional crystalline counterparts.

We will move right now to carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes are long, hollow structures with walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, which we usually call "graphene" in the scientific literature. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete chiral angles; and the combination of the rolling angle and the radius decides the nanotube properties. Individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into ropes held together by the so-called van der Waals forces - or more specifically, pi-stacking. Usually, the end of a carbon nanotube ends with a half-buckyball-like carbon structure.

Carbon nanotubes have unusual properties that are valuable for nanotechnology, electronics, optics, and other fields of materials science and technology. In particular, due to their extraordinary thermal conductivity and mechanical and electrical properties, carbon tubes find applications as additives to various structural materials - for instance, nanotubes form a tiny portion of the material in some carbon fiber baseball bats, golf clubs, or car parts.

An inorganic nanotube is often composed of metal oxides. Inorganic nanotubes show various advantages, such as easy synthesis, high crystallinity, good uniformity and dispersion, well-defined electrical conductivity, good adhesion to a number of polymers, and high impact resistance. These materials are therefore promising candidates as fillers for polymer composites with enhanced thermal, mechanical, and electrical properties. Inorganic nanotubes are heavier than carbon nanotubes - which we explained in the last slide - and therefore they don't have strongness under tensile stress; but they are particularly strong under compression, thus leading to potential applications in impact-resistant applications - such as bulletproof vests.

Two representative examples of inorganic nanotubes include - as can be seen on the slide - boron nitride nanotubes. This material has a high resistance to oxidation, suited for high temperatures; it also has a Young's modulus of 1.22 terapascals; and it behaves as a semiconducting material. Of course, the electronic properties of this material are predictable.

On the other hand, I would represent - on the same slide - an example of silicon carbon nanotubes, which have high resistance to oxidation and are quite suitable for harsh environments; and they can be functionalized with organic monomers on their surfaces.

With this, we come now to the end of class number one, session number two. Thank you!
