Good afternoon, I'm a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Bits and Atoms. I know the name of the Center is quite provocative, and indeed, we do a lot with bits, including bio-bits. Today, I want to talk to you about bio-nanotechnology, an emerging science where we learn from how biology does things and then we steal, copy, emulate, and mimic the ways of biology first by understanding and then by co-opting and engineering out of it.

What drives us mostly is curiosity. We've recognized that to understand something, as Richard Feynman said, you have to first build it. If you don't know how to build something, you don't understand it. If we don't know how to build a photosynthetic solar cell, we don't really understand photosynthesis very well. If we don't know how to build an electronic nose to mimic the dog's nose, let's say, we don't really understand olfaction—the sense of smell.

So, that's what drives us—it's basically curiosity. But most of the time when you start with a basic curiosity-driven endeavor, you always almost always end up with applications that are very, very interesting. That's the best way to describe it, I think. Is to just go over a couple of the things we've done lately in the lab so you get a sense of how this works.

What do those things really look like? What does our everyday life look like in the lab and at the end? I'd like to maybe tell you how you can participate in this process and feel a sense of ownership of science, because that is changing everybody's life, whether you like it or not, and it will continue changing the way we live, the way we interact with each other, and the planet in an always accelerating way.

So, let's talk a little bit about design versus evolution. Designed by humans is much faster than evolution, but oftentimes we get inspired by evolved designs or evolve structures for instance. We were inspired by birds to create the Wright Flyer; it flew for a distance smaller than from me to the last person here in the audience. Everybody made fun of it because it was a rickety machine and not two generations later, it could fly twice the speed of sound going from Paris to New York, sipping a little bit of champagne.

You could be alive and conscious; you could still ride the Concorde still in one lifetime. The way the technology works now and science works now, we are much faster than this because of computers, because of the internet, because of global availability of information, because of things like Wikipedia. Those things are changing the world, and one of the biggest ways that the world is changing is by accelerating the pace of technological advancements.

What does this mean for bio-nanotechnology? Well, just like we adapted some biologists' designs now, we're starting to domesticate molecules. This is a quote by a colleague and good friend, Professor Susan Linkus from MIT, who received the Science Prize from Obama in 2010. She says that about 10,000 years ago, we started domesticating plants and animals, and now it's time to domesticate molecules.

Think about it for a second; we started 10,000 years ago with a wolf, and now we have 10,000 different kinds of dogs. Some are good at herding sheep, others are good at going down holes and finding rats, others are good companions, others can help the blind, others can smell cancer and diagnose it. We did this by directed evolution; we bred the dogs to have certain characteristics.

Now, that process is faster than natural selection but nowhere near as fast as designed design. I should say for black of a better word or designed evolution, which is what we do now, and we're now doing it at the level of the molecules. So, DNA can be thought of loosely as being the software of life, and proteins are the hardware. Proteins are the machine that DNA codes for; sort of DNA is the blueprint.

Today, we're going to talk about two kinds of proteins. They're both membrane proteins, meaning they like to live inside a cell's membrane, having water on both sides—it's not very good environment for something that you want to integrate with electronics. But they are all factory receptors. These are the things that allow you to sense your environment by the scent of by the sense of smell also known as olfaction and electrolysis.

Photosynthesis is at the very basic level behind everything that's living. You eat solar energy when you eat meat or vegetables; those things essentially stored solar power plants take the sunlight and create C-H bonds, create their own flesh like literally eating the Sun. When you put gas in your car, that is stored solar power.

The dinosaurs ate the plants; they fell into the various millions of years ago; they got compacted into this black goo now we extract that we burn it and we make energy that way. How about we short-circuit all that whole process and get the energy directly out of the Sun by using what photosynthesis does?

This is my playground, my place. Set this up; this is the kind of stuff I play with. Molecules let's start from maybe a nanometer or so and they go up all the way up to maybe a few hundred nanometers in the case of polymers and we can engineer them and play with them.

Just like here's an example on the left side is photosystem one, this is at the heart of the Earth's energy cycle. This is what captures light makes it into chemical energy which then you can eat or put in your gas tank after the dinosaurs ate so on. The right side shows how we engineered the system.

We note that we almost took everything directly from nature; we're not that good yet; we're not to the point where we are with airplanes, you don't see jet engines made out of feathers. For bio-photovoltaics, we're still taking a lot straight out of the green stuff that is both good and bad.

It's good because green stuff is very cheap and easy to combine; it's bad because it's finicky and complex and difficult to work with. What you see on the right is one of the world's first ever bio-photovoltaics, meaning it's a solar panel making electricity the same way that plants capture sunlight and make chemical energy.

The first step in making chemical energy for the plant is to create a little bit of electricity. So, we hijack that function and create solar panels with the reason we can do this nowadays is because we have this molecular playset kind of like a Lego set of designed short molecules that allows us to stabilize these proteins outside of the natural environment.

These things are used to live inside of a cell's membrane, same as our factory receptors. I'll talk about in a second and they like to be between two places that are full of water—it's not very good for electronics but we found out that if we can apply these stabilizing peptides to them, it's essentially putting them in stasis.

So, these proteins are still alive in a sense but outside of their natural environment; they're still doing what they do in the plant but no longer inside of the plant. They've been domesticated—it's just like the wolf is no longer the wolf; it's now the dog that's helping you do so much.

This is a diagram very scientific, I'm not going to go through it but people often ask me what does it look like? What I mean all these cartoons but how do you actually interact with these things and it's a little bit like being in a submarine. You don't see the other guy; you have to look at all the screens and donors and things like this.

So, everything is graphs and output and sometimes you have pictures but most of the time we don't and we have pictures like this which is how we explain how we stabilize these molecules but it's like our tune now. We cured not only to figure out how for the synthesis works but also wondered whether we can by lowering the cost of the raw material that you need to make a solar panel maybe we can really disrupt the way that electricity is being consumed and produced around the world and bring it to people who have none.

So, we looked at very different sources and we can use pretty much anything green including seaweed. We care about this because it's the only thing that I know of that has a negative cost of the raw material; you pay people to take your grass clippings away imagine if those grass clippings could now be made into solid panels.

So, we did this and it became very famous went to the Boston Museum of Science but the problem is because you have to have a monolayer very thin layer of these proteins. The thing didn't absorb enough light; in fact, if you look at the bottom center, the reporter who took that picture is cheating they put it in a green background so that you can see that the chip is actually green.

Because I guess it's green technology that resonates really well with the public so that's what the newspapers did. The problem here is that it wasn't thick enough; it didn't absorb enough light and if it doesn't absorb enough light, it's not giving enough energy.

So, I was trying to solve this problem and I was in Japan and I looked at this took this picture of this tree if you look at the tree down the middle it's sort of cheating with respect to its little brothers and sisters by having leaves down its trunk so whatever light trickles down from the top this tree gets to eat it. The others don't.

So, we decided do the same thing and make a nano forest now people spoke about failure earlier so important to realize that 90% of what we do is failure. We cannot go forward in research without having a very thick skin for failure. So, this is an example of a failure.

We decided we're going to make these nano trunks out of carbon nanotubes and that would have been great but put the leaves like this leaves now being are photosynthetic proteins but then the problem was we should have seen this. The nanotubes are very black so whatever light doesn't get absorbed by the first layer gets observed by the nanotubes gets changed into heat instead of electricity not very useful.

But just like the other speaker said, it's important to try; it's important to do things then fail then try again. So, if black nano trunks for the Nano forests are too bad what's the next best thing? Well, something that is clear and transparent and in fact we did this now this is a great case.

We would have pictures those are zinc oxide not a wire tree trunks for the Nano forests and they can be grown it without even using a heat or a flame room temperature in a dirty vat you can do this in Africa and up on some little bit of genetic engineering. We can connect our proteins and make solar panels out of grass clippings ideally.

This is what's published here ideally what we would like to do here; we don't really care about replacing silicon solar panels in the Western world but what we'd like to do is get to the point where we can send somebody just a bag of material that they need to stabilize these proteins that we can create in the lab and it's non-hazardous and it's cheap and inexpensive.

And then with very low-skilled labor, they go outside of their own community gather some things and make their own solar power. So, changing the equation from being only consumers but to producers so essentially making solar power making electricity as easy as cooking.

We're almost there and this we feel it's going to be disruptive because the number one way out of poverty is nighttime illumination if you have nighttime illumination, you can educate yourself. The number one way that people who have no electricity—the poorest people in the world—have for nighttime illumination is also the most expensive way to get light.

They use paraffin candles and they use kerosene which is also awful for their health so the people who have the least and the people who need illumination the most get to pay the highest amount of money to just have a light. Book by changing this by allowing them to have perhaps not the most efficient but something that can grow and make themselves out of locally available material with ultra-low cost.

I think we can change the world now. You'd think how is that related to smelling cancer? It's essentially the same problem again; we're taking something that exists in nature, namely the receptors out of human dogs or other noses by the way then while before we're taking real plants and extracting it in this case everything is synthetic.

We know the code from a DNA that encodes for the genes that encode for the proteins and we design everything in the lab. I push up at design in the computer; push a button, a couple of days later, I have the folded protein that I need to make an electronic nose.

So, this was given to us as a challenge that told me can you make this now. Some of the audience—the older ones perhaps will remember this—is that when I was 11 years old on a big small black and white TV in Athens I saw this guy and I saw him holding this for the first time I saw Star Trek, I was captivated and terrified at the same time and I wondered how he did this.

And that 11 years old it dawned on me can't be by light; can't be by radio because it goes around corners and it sniffs out where the people are in the weather waters and I realized back then this has got to be a nose of some sort. It's going to smell the things that it's looking for.

So, we look at how does nature detect scent and it ends up being that you have humans at least have 391 receptors stuck right here not here this is just there to hydrate and warm up the air when you're sniffing something. It is your brain; it's directly your brain that does that gives you this experience.

There is a piece of what's called the olfactory bulb that sticks through the skull through tiny little holes and sticks and literally hangs in the breeze so whenever you have something, you are actually directly interacting with molecules with your brain.

So, we copied this system and it looks like this right now. It's about this big and we call it the nano-nose and just like the dog or the human; it doesn't know any chemistry; it's not an analytical device; it doesn't tell you what things are made of; it just tells you what their smell is out.

So, the point of this is that this is the first time we have something like this. There's been many electronic noses before but in this case, we're not doing analysis; we're not saying oh, we're trying to find the bomb in the airport and we're not exactly what the bomb material smells like.

We're saying if I have a dog and I trained the dog to find the rose then the dog will be able to find me another rose in the flower store that's all we do. The dog does not know any chemistry; the dog is not doing analysis; doesn't know, doesn't need to know what the chemicals are of the scent but the dog can be trying to find cancer at a very early stage.

So, the applications are of course, we start by wanting to know how olfaction works. It's our last sense that we don't understand everything else we understand pretty well; vision, audition, heat and touch and taste but we still don't really get how olfaction works.

From this work, we actually also found out that at least flies sniffing they also look at the shape of the molecule at their sniffing they also look at the vibrational spectrum which already has made us come up with designs for bettering noses not using the biological component at all but changing it to quantum nanotubes, quantum dots I should say and nanotubes.

And things like this just like we don't make jet engines out of feathers eventually we will not need the biology to do any of these things. We're participating in the Qualcomm XPrize which is to make exactly that tricorder that Spock was holding which in two-and-a-half years from now will have to be able to put it in the size of a cell phone.

Give it to a hundred people and over the period of two weeks smell these people without interacting with them directly and be able to tell with 85 percent success rate fifteen different diseases. It will be blind—and we hope we could do this so if you have to take something out of this today I think that the message is that nature already knows how to fly how to make electricity how to compute how to detect odors etc.

And if nature has shown it to be doable then it is unavoidable that we will do it. This isn't cold fusion; cold fusion may or may not work; we don't know we've never seen it in nature but to make a device that can fit in a thing like this and sniff cancer yes absolutely it's doable not only doable it's unavoidable.

We'll get there whether we like it or not. We already have whether we're stealing the designs we're using biological components but what really biology does is it allows us atomic precision control over the 118 elements of the periodic table anything that biology can do right now we're learning to do better, faster, cheaper and we will go to places where biology never dreamed of.

Now, where does that mean? What does the future look like? Well, already we have a grant based on this work to go the next level which is the Star Trek replicator yes believe it or not they are paying me money to build the machine that you can push a button and the cup of tea will materialize out of the 118 elements the periodic table without involving any tea plants or ceramics or anything just atom by atom put it there.

Not quite there yet when state phase one but within our lifetime this will happen. You know what else we're doing? We're making machines that self-replicate now this may be scary and you probably right to feel like you need some ownership of this. Scientists are sitting out there in their labs how do you get to how do you get to participate the best way I know of is to ask questions.

It's the ultimate equalizer scientists love questions that's what drives us. You can engage a scientist by just asking a good question and recognizing the importance of questions we have created the molecular frontiers inquiry prize where we award five boys and five girls every year a prize for the best question asked.

We have the panel including 30 Nobel laureates judging this every time in Stockholm in Sweden and some of the questions are fantastic. For instance, somebody asked why aren't plants black that's a much better question than asking why are plants green and what it did was generate real research by real universities.

So please these are my funders I have to put this up there they pay the mails and please inspire anybody under 18 to go to this website and submit their questions. The deadline for this year is in May, and we're looking forward to the entries and that's the best way to engage in this process. Thank you very much.
