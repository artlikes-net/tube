welcome to class number one session number three in this session we will continue what we have already started in session number two of class number one two-dimensional structures include thin films planner Quantum well and super latices as could be seen on the screen as a representative example of thin film please have a look on scanning teling microscope image of a self assembled monol of andican thiolate on gold surface as seen in the image the individual molecules closely packed into hexagonal array also besides that one can see clearly the features of the assembly and the surface namely one can see domain boundaries which are highlighted with light blue stripes on the figure and one can see also gold vacancy Islands which can be seen as circular blue spots in the lower image of the screen you can see a transmission electron microscopy image of a super latice where alternate layers of two different materials exist in this context please note that the thickness of each layer is only 2 nanometer in thickness one of the major groups in two-dimensional structures is thin film namely two dimensional film with a thickness that range between 1 to 100 nanometer when films are very thin their electronic and Optical properties deviate substantially from those of the bulk material as the material is minized towards the nanoc scale the confining D di menion naturally decreases but the characteristics are no longer averaged by the bulk the energy Spectrum becomes in this case discrete and measured by quanta rather than continuous as in the bulk materials the confinement of the electrons that exist in these systems changed their interaction with the electromagnetic radiation sign iFly electrons are confined in the direction that is perpendicular to the substrate and thus affect the wave function as well as the density of these states similarly phonons that are confined in the direction that is perpendicular to the substrate affect therefore the thermal property all transport phenomena in the twood dimensional structures are highly affected by defects boundaries and interfaces that might exist in or at the vicinity of the thin film more details about all of these effects will be given in the next classes now we will move to the threedimensional structure which include bulk nanocrystalline as well as nanoc Composites nanostructured bulk materials include several subcategories which are mentioned in the following the first subcategory is crystalline materials in this category the atoms molecules or ions which make up a material are arranged in an orderly repeating pattern in some cases the regular ordering can continue unbroken over a large scale such as in the example of diamonds where each diamond is only single Crystal the second subcategory is called poly crystalline materials solid objects that are large enough to see and to handle are rarely composed of single material but instead are made of large number of single crystals known as crystalites whose size can vary from a few nanometers to several meters such materials are called poly crystalline as mentioned previously almost all common metals and many Ceramics are poly christalline in their properties the third subcategory of this material is called amoros materials this category which we call also non crystalline solid is a solid that lacks the long range order characteristic of a crystalline indeed amorphous materials have some short range order at the atomic length scale due to the nature of chemical bonding such solids include amongst the rest glass plastic and gel now we will move to the nanocomposites a nanocomposite is a multiphase solid material where one of the phases has one two or three dimensions of less than 100 nanometer in the broadest sense this definition is more usually taken to mean the solid combination of a bu Matrix and Nano dimensional phase differing in properties due to the similarities in structure and chemistry the mechanical electrical thermal Optical electrochemical catalytic properties of the nanocomposite differ quite significantly from those of the component material size limits for these effects have been proposed in the scientific literature and include among the rest the following Composites with less than 5 nanometer nanomaterials are designated for catalytic activity Composites with less than 20 nanometer nanomaterials are designated for making hard magnetic material and Composites with less than 50 nanometer nanomaterials are designated for refractive index changes and finally a composite with less than 100 nanometer nanomaterials are designated for achieving mechanical strengthen or restricting Matrix dislocation movement nanocomposites might include combinations of or oric material and organic material it also can include a combination of organic and inorganic material and finally it can include a combination of in orgenic and in orgenic materials this large amount of reinforcement surface area means that a relatively small amount of nanoscale reinforcement can have an observable effect on the macroscale property of the composite for example adding carbon and tubes improves the electrical and thermal conductivity other kinds of nanoparticulates may result in enhanced Optical properties dielectric properties heat resistance or mechanical properties such as stiffness strength and resistance to wear and damage we will come now to the end of class number one session number three thank you
